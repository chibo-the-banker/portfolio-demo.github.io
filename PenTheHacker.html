     Whaling is a phishing attack that targets high-level employees, eg. CEOs and CFOs. The intruder conducts information gathering using open source information such as social media posts, job posts with specific skills requirements, friends and relatives. The research is very invasive but not illegal at this point.
     The attacker can use the credentials of low-level employees to gather more information on the high-level employees. The goal of the intruder is to gain sensitive information from the employee, such as receipts which may shed the light on the suppply chain. The supply chain includes service provikder and service receivers 
     such as clients and contractors of the company.
